# terraform

terraform plan shows what changes Terraform will apply to your infrastructure given the current state of your infrastructure as well as the current contents of your configuration.

terraform apply in the same directory as your example.tf, and watch it go! It will take a few minutes since Terraform waits for the EC2 instance to become available.
